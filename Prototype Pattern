Prototype pattern is a creational design pattern. This means it handles the scenarios where we are creating objects. There are couple of things that I got know during my inital learning:
1. As the name itself is suggesting, this pattern will have a "Prototype" from where objects will be created. This prototype is an interface which has a virtual method: clone().
2. Any class that implements this interface will implement the clone() accordingly.
3. Why to use Prototype pattern you ask, well if object creation is expensive then cloning is better.

The questions that I currently have:
1. I read in an article that one object is created from a class that is implementing prototype interface and after that all the objects are cloned from that object. Is this true? If yes, why?
2. What is "client" in context of Prototype design pattern?
